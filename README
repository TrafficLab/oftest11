This package contains two complementary software components:

* OFTest is an OpenFlow switch regression testing suite.
        See README.oftest for details
    

* ofps is a reference OpenFlow switch implemented in python
        See README.ofps for details

These components are used to mutually validate each other and thus they
are packaged together.


Quick start:

# create and install the oftest.egg into system's
#       python site-package dir
cd tools/munger
sudo make install       

# start ofps in foreground
cd tests
sudo ./run_switch.py

# start oftest (likely in new window)
cd tests
sudo ./oft --verbose
