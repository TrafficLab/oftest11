Notes on implementation

Threads

  Each dataplane port is a thread.  It might make more sense to have
the dataplane class be a thread and do a select on all the interfaces
it maintains for ports. Not sure it would make a lot of difference.

  The controller interface is a thread

Synchronization

  The main resource, access to which must synchronized, is the
flow table.  This is managed by the Lock member, flow_sync, in the
FlowTable class.


DataPlane

  Currently "real" (OS) interfaces are required for communicating.  This
may be relaxed in the future to allow communication over UDP.  This
would simplify the setup a lot.
